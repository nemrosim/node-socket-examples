What are the best uses of WebRTC seen on the web today?
As of now, probably there have been many use cases of WebRTC across industries. Telehealth, financial services, education, recruitment, and field services; almost all other sectors are using WebRTC in some or the other way.

1. File sharing: Say you're working on a project and want to send massive files to your colleagues. You can directly send it through web browser using WebRTC instead of emailing and uploading it to third-party cloud storage.

2. Multiparty video conferencing: You can create a multi-user video conference using WebRTC and establish a direct peer to peer connection with one another. Every platform provides free trial in starting, up to limited people. But scalability depends on the hardware and bandwidth, and you can also scale using multipoint control units and selective forwarding units.

3. Screen sharing: You can share your share with your colleagues during meetings and discussions. It helps you to get better and clear ideas for the work in progress and its outcomes.

4. Broadcasting: You may not broadcast with WebRTC, but it enables one-way media transmissions like concerts, speeches, podcasts, and live videos. Few WebRTC platforms also allow you with real-time access to participants attendance.

5. Embedded endpoints: You can connect with live agents when you're on-the-go using WebRTC. You can embed vending machines, ATMs, bus stops, and retail store kiosks with WebRTC engines.

6. Sales enablement: You can help your sales reps using this technology. You can provide ongoing assistance during the purshasing process by integrating your website or application with a WebRTC channel.

7. Emergency response: WebRTC is playing major role in public safety. You can also use location based services and safeguard interactions enabling text communications, audio, and video communications. WebRTC data channel also allows you to have a deeper insight to previously existing communications, when responding to emergency calls.

8. Patient management: You can also reduce patient visits and queue by using WebRTC based solutions for ongoing treatments. WebRTC platform helps you to give more time to higher priority patients.
